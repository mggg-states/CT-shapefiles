# Connecticut Election Shapefiles
This shapefile was compiled and processed by members of the Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering Group (MGGG).  

## Sources
Raw data for Connecticut's voting district boundaries was sourced from election and other town officials and processed by members of MGGG. Precinct-level election results were obtained from the Connecticut Secretary of State's [Election Center](https://ctemspublic.pcctg.net/#/home). Block level demographic data for the 2010 Decennial Census were retrieved using the [Census API](https://api.census.gov/data/2010/dec/sf1).

## Preprocessing
Of Connecticut's 169 towns, 65 have a townwide precinct, 36 towns' voting districts matched the 2010 Census VTDs, and the remaining 68 were digitized from maps provided by the towns or edited using the state voterfile. Demographic data were aggregated from the census block level and voting districts were assigned to districts using [MGGG's proration software](https://github.com/mggg/maup).
